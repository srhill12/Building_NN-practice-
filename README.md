## Dependencies used
* Pandas
* train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection
* Standard_Scaler from sklean.preprocessing
* Tensorflot

## Instructions

* Visualize the generated dataset using a Pandas scatter plot.

* Randomly split the dummy data into training and test datasets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split` method.

* Normalize both datasets using scikit-learn's `StandardScaler` class.

* Using the Keras module, create a basic neural network with five neurons in the hidden layer.

  * **Note:** The neural network should use two inputs (i.e. the number of features in the dataset) and produce one classification output.

* Compile a basic neural network model.

* Train the neural network model over 50 epochs.

* Evaluate the performance the model by printing the test loss metric and determining the predictive accuracy of the model on the test dataset.

* Create a line plot that visualizes the neural network predictive accuracy over each epoch.
